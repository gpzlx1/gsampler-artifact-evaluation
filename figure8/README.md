# Introduction

This guide aims to assist users in reproducing Figure 8 from the paper.

# Run Experiments

To run the experiments, execute the following 4 complex algorithms:

```shell
export epochs=6
bash testbench.sh
```

After running the commands, you will find the 4 result figures in PDF format located in the `outputs/` directory. For an example, refer to `../fig_examples/figure8`.
