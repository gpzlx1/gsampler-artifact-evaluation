# Introduction

The guide is to help users to reproduce figure8 in the paper.

# Run Experiments

There are 4 complex algorithms in total to be run.

```shell
export epochs=6
bash testbench.sh
```

Then, the 4 pdf format figures of results will be generated in `outputs/` dir. See `../fig_examples/figure8` for example.
